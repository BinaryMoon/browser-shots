Automate the process of taking website screenshots.

== Description ==

Use the `[browser-shot]` shortcode to automate the process of taking website screenshots. An icon is also added to the TinyMCE editor to make the shortcode creation process easy.

= Shortcode Preview =

`// basic shot 600px wide
[browser-shot url="http://link-to-website" width="600"]

// shot with link to other website
[browser-shot url="http://link-to-website" width="700" link="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/"]

// shot with caption (uses default WordPress caption styles)
[browser-shot url="http://link-to-website" width="700"]Add Caption[/browser-shot]`

= Available Parameters =

* url (required) - the url of the link to shorten
* width - the width of the image
* height - the height of the image
* alt - the image alt text
* link - where the image links. Left blank it will point to the website where the screenshot is being taken
* target - browser target. Set to _blank to open in a new window
* class - add a class to the browsershots wrapper
* image_class - change the default browsershots image class from alignnone to your chosen class
* display_link (true or false - default true) to display a link in your screenshot
* post_links (true or false - default false) to link to the permalink of the post the screenshot is on

= Generating Screenshots with code =

If you want to create screenshots in a theme using this plugin then you can do so using the `BrowserShots::get_shot` method.

For example:

`<img src="<?php echo BrowserShots::get_shot( 'https://prothemedesign.com', 600, 450 ); ?>" />`

Keep in mind that the plugin must be installed and activated for this to work.

The get_shot method has 3 parameters.

1. The url.
2. The width.
3. The height.

The other parameters, from the shotcode, can be implemented manually when outputting the html.

= Multisite Compatibility =

The *Browser Shots* plugin is compatibly with WordPress Multisite, just use the [Network Activate](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network#WordPress_Plugins) feature to enable the shortcode on every site. If you only want to enable the shortcode for a specific site, activate the plugin for that site only.
